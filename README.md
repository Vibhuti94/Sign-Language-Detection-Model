# Sign-Language-Detection-Model
A machine learning-based project that recognizes and translates sign language gestures into text or speech. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and real-time video processing to bridge communication gaps between sign language users and others. The system is designed for accessibility and inclusivity.

#Features  
- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects and classifies hand gestures in real-time.  
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Outputs the corresponding text for recognized signs.  

# Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset or publicly available sign language datasets (e.g., ASL Alphabet Dataset).

# Results
Achieved high accuracy in classifying common hand gestures.
Real-time detection runs smoothly with minimal latency.

# Future Enhancements
Extend to recognize a broader range of signs.
Add support for dynamic (continuous) gestures.
Develop a mobile app for real-world usability.
