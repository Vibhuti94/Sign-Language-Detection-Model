# Sign-Language-Detection-Model
A machine learning-based project that recognizes and translates sign language gestures into text or speech. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and real-time video processing to bridge communication gaps between sign language users and others. The system is designed for accessibility and inclusivity.
